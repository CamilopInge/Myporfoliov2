            p1: "I started studying systems engineering in 2021, creating web designs. I didn't exploit my creativity much but I got along quite well within the code, creating functionalities in the Back-end. I haven't had the privilege of working with a company, but I support myself with projects to solve problems.",
            p2: "My main current goal is to continue working on experience and error management. What I like most is creating scalable, aesthetic and effective software, that looks well designed but works the right way. In my free time I upload videos to YouTube about Linux (Servers, Installations, Console)",
            p3: "When I'm not in front of the computer, I like to study, play, read and exercise. I usually think about how to improve every day and I even put code in my life to help me make things easier (I could do it in 1 minute but I decided to automate it), currently I'm looking to develop what I'm doing."
