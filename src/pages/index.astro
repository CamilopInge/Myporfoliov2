                Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
                themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and

                My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces

                the sweet spot where design and engineering meet — things that
                look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free
                time, I've also released an online video course that covers
                everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify
                API.

                When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing,
                reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running
                around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds
